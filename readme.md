This book is aimed at beginners who are looking to start building applications using Laravel and are ready to get their hands dirty pretty fast by building a minimal project that covers most of the Laravel framework basics and a few advanced features that might seem overwhelming at first. 

Intermediate users too who are relatively new to Laravel or are seeking better ways to architect small to medium-sized applications will also find this book beneficial.

##What will you learn
This book will show you how to build a simple inventory application. It will cover topics such as Blade Templating where we will be taking a random Bootstrap theme and converting it into a lean template which we can extend for all our pages, Authentication for our registration and login, Policy to restrict access to user data, Eloquent ORM to show you different database table relationships and what is soft deletes, Email setup and configuration, Routing types, naming and grouping and finally we will be setting up a very simple CRON JOB  using a third-party service to perform minimalistic task.

Most of all you will be learning how to write production-quality code by adhering to a standard naming convention, practices and writing DRY(Do, not repeat yourself) codes.

##Note
So as not to overwhelm beginners we would not be following the TDD (Test Driven Development) process.
